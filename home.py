This application is designed to analyze the sentiment expressed in text messages. It utilizes a trained Naive Bayes classifier to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the words used.

How it Works:

Input: Users input their name and describe how they are feeling today in the provided text boxes.
Analysis: The application examines the words in the input message to determine its sentiment.
Classification: Words are compared against predefined lists of positive, negative, and neutral words. If a match is found, the sentiment is displayed accordingly.
Feedback: Additionally, users receive motivational messages tailored to their sentiment to uplift their mood.
Output: The application outputs the user's name along with an assessment of their sentiment and an encouraging message.
Key Features:

Customizable: Users can input their name and express their feelings freely.

This web application leverages a machine learning model to classify uploaded images based on food categories. Using a pre-trained model, it analyzes features extracted from images to predict and display the category of food depicted.

How it Works:

Input: Users upload an image containing food items using the sidebar file uploader.

Analysis: The application extracts visual features from the uploaded image using a deep learning model.

Classification: The extracted features are processed through a trained classifier, which predicts the category of food in the image.

Output: The predicted food category is displayed alongside the uploaded image, providing instant classification results.

Key Features:

Efficient Classification: Utilizes image embeddings for accurate food category prediction.
User-friendly Interface: Simple file upload interface with real-time classification feedback.
Scalable: Handles image uploads up to 5MB in size for comprehensive food image analysis.
Try it Out:

Upload: Select an image file containing food items.
Predict: Click the "Predict Category" button to see the predicted food category.
Explore: Explore various food images and see how accurately they are classified!
